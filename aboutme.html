    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h3>My name is Wyvern, I'm an artist who's currently learning to code. This website will display the fruits of my labor.</h3>
    <p>The goal is to learn HTML then CSS as a way to occupy my time this summer (2022) and because I want to be a programmer in the future!
It's not going to look pretty for a long while so bear with me.</p>
